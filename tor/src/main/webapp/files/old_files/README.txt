PG left these files behind as an archive of last year's hunt -- Raccada, as you guys call it. Funnily enough, I actually nicknamed it "Cicoon" when I was solving this alone for the first time. I have no use for these files anymore, but maybe you'll find them interesting.

PG left solutions for all four puzzles, but didn't record what was at the final intersection. I'm not at liberty to share the full content of what was there, but the gist was that there was a poster in a nook in the SDSC courtyard, across the grassy field. There was an encrypted phone number, which I called to receive a prerecorded message by PG telling me how to contact them further, and instructions to remove the poster once I found it. You know how the rest went.

If I'm still breathing by midnight on June 2, you know where to find me. All bad things must come to an end...

P.S. I asked PG where the idea for Raccada 1 came from. He just sent me this video:
