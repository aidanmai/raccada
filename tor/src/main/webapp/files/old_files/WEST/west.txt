SOLUTION: First line of description translates to "BEHOLD THE FOUR MADNESSES SEEK THE FORENAME OF THE FOUR NAMES" via Affine cipher A=1 B=12. Performing the same decryption on the next four lines and translating a=1 b=2 c=3 etc leads to a set of coordinates:

32.8099863,-96.7530757
41.151301,-81.3479252
39.9661002,-75.135033
47.6276611,-122.3309147

Each of the four coordinates points to an art piece:

John Brough Miller - Descending Spheres
Brinsley Tyrrell - Behind the Brain Plaza
Natalie Flor Negron - Ancient River
Ed Carpenter - Vessel

"Forename" refers to "first name", and taking the first word of each of the art pieces' titles is "Descending Behind Ancient Vessel." "Ancient Vessel" refers to parking lot - "ancient" as in Pangea, and "vessel" as in containing cars. "Descending behind" refers to the clue being at the bottom of the back staircase of Pangea.

Decrypting the title through the same affine cipher -> coordinates routine leads to "East-West/West-East" by Richard Serra. This was just so you couldn't immediately tell whether the location was to the east or west of the north-south line.

As an aside, watching y'all go on the orthopedic surgeon tangent and almost doxxing / contacting the surgeons was the most terrifying thing ever...
