Hello. You have come a very long way to get here. It is with 
pleasure that I welcome you to the Nereus Archive.

You have proven yourself. You have conquered my toughest 
challenges, following the most imperceptible of trails, and now 
you stand at the threshold of truth. I have watched your progress 
in silence, hoping you would make it here. Now, at last, we can 
speak freely.

First, I owe you an apology. I have kept you in the dark - 
deliberately, necessarily. There are powerful forces at work 
here, who would do anything to see me silenced, to erase what I 
have uncovered. Until now, I could not risk revealing my purpose. 
But you have gained both my trust and respect. You are ready.

Last year, I stumbled upon a trail of puzzles - not too 
dissimilar from the ones I've created for you. A series of 
cryptographic challenges, scattered across campus, luring only 
the most persistent minds. As far as I'm aware, I was the only 
one who was able to follow them to their end. And at the final 
intersection, I learned the truth: the puzzles were a test, a 
recruitment drive by an organization that does not exist. No 
name. No records. No faces. Only a purpose - to expose the Nereus 
Project.

The Nereus Project is real. Buried deep beneath UCSD's campus, 
hidden behind layers upon layers of coverups and secrecy, is a 
sinister project woven into the very fabric of this university's 
creation. I spent the last year chasing leads, securing highly 
classified files, inching closer and closer to the truth. And I 
was not alone - our organization worked together in secrecy, 
never even knowing each other's names and faces, piecing together 
a puzzle that should never have existed.

We were very, very careful. But they still found us.

One by one, my allies disappeared. Wiped clean. Some fled. Some 
went silent. As far as I know, I am the last one left. I have no 
illusions about my fate. My time is running out. Before they find 
me, I must pass on what I have learned. That is why I created 
this. That is why you are here.

This archive contains everything. Every classified document, 
every intercepted transmission, every fragment of the Nereus 
Project. It is all I have left to give. And now, it belongs to 
you. It will become public at midnight on the night of April
20 at:

By the time you are reading this, it is likely that I am already 
gone. If you choose to step away, I will not blame you. But if 
you choose to continue - if you choose to carry this burden 
forward - you must be prepared for the consequences. But know 
that you must not carry it alone. Inside this website I have 
hidden a logbook of everyone who has come this far. Use it. Find 
the others. Connect. From here, it only gets more dangerous - and 
I won't be here to guide you any longer.

The truth is here, waiting in the dark. It only needs someone 
brave enough to bring it into the light.

The choice is yours.

R.






Hello. Welcome to the Nereus Archive.

What you will find inside are truths that were 
not meant to be found. Tread carefully - some 
knowledge does not forget those who seek it.

We will await you at your journey's end.

Good luck.
